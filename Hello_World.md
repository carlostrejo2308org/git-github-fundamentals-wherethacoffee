# Hello, teacher Carlos!

> I've just finished the course from the github bot and I really liked it! it is very simple and ***beginner-friendly***, even though I used some tools from Github before, such as *"commit"*, *"push"*, *"fork"* or *"branch"*, they weren't too much clear for me but now they're all ***crystal clear***, except for one of them... *"pull request"*, I tried to do just one in this repository but I couldn't, so I think it would be a good idea to check it out in tomorrow's      class.
